# Claude's choices

Decisions made without asking, each saying what was chosen, what else
was possible, and why, so any can be revisited. Newest last.

## C1. Reference clones in `~/Dev/Rust/kayak-refs` (2026-10-11)

The user asked for the analysis to be done on separate clones of Fixpt
and coopt.
- **Chosen:** plain clones at `~/Dev/Rust/kayak-refs/fixpt` and
  `~/Dev/Rust/kayak-refs/coopt`, outside the repository. Fixpt's pin is
  `FIXPT_REV` (`DONE.md` §4).
- **Not chosen:** coopt's own clone, `~/Dev/Rust/fixpt-ref`, which coopt
  moves on its own schedule; a submodule, which puts Fixpt's history in
  kayak's tree, as coopt also declined (its C1).

## C2. Fixpt as stage 0 (2026-10-11)

- **Chosen:** Fixpt runs `kfx.kfx` to make the first `boot/`. The
  transpiler is written once, in KFX, and the first run of the bootstrap
  is also K1's check.
- **Not chosen:** a stage 0 written by hand in Rust (draft 1's `kfx0`):
  the transpiler written twice.
- **Why:** the user's priority was closing the loop fast, and a probe
  showed Fixpt fast enough (a 60 KB source, 60K-deep recursion, instant).
  Once the loop closed, building no longer needs Fixpt.

## C3. Every value `Copy`; memory never freed (2026-10-11)

- **Chosen:** scalars are themselves; everything else is a `&'static`
  reference to memory leaked with `Box::leak`. Mutation, when it comes,
  is `Cell`.
- **Not chosen:** `Rc`, which frees memory but makes values not `Copy`,
  filling the generated code with `.clone()`, and leaks cycles anyway.
- **Why:** the mapping stays trivial, and a compiler run is short:
  compiling the compiler peaks at 10 MB. Places as lifetimes
  (`TODO.md` §14) generalise it.

## C4. Strings are ASCII (2026-10-11)

- **Chosen:** `string` is `&'static str`, and `string-ref` a byte index,
  refused past ASCII.
- **Not chosen:** a string of `char`s, which indexes characters but needs
  converting to print; a scan to the `i`th character, which is O(n).
- **Why:** O(1) indexing with no conversion; the compiler's source is
  ASCII. `TODO.md` §17.

## C5. The mangling (2026-10-11)

- **Chosen:** a primitive and the Rust function implementing it share a
  name: `-` is `_` (alone or last, `_minus`), `?` `_p`, `!` `_x`, `->`
  `_to_`, `+ * < > = /` `_plus _star _lt _gt _eq _slash`; a Rust keyword
  takes `r#`. Datatypes and type names are CamelCase.
- **Why:** reversible, so the Rust can be read back as KFX, and no table
  of primitives is needed in the compiler: the generated module imports
  `kayak_rt::*`, and the names meet.

## C6. Docstrings (2026-10-11)

The user approved strings as comments.
- **Chosen:** a string first in a procedure's body is its documentation,
  as in Lisp; at the top level a string is a plain comment.
- **Not chosen:** a top-level string before a definition as its doc
  comment, which took section headers for documentation (`DONE.md` §3).

## C7. The prelude's names (2026-10-11)

- **Chosen:** `string-length-i64`, `string-ref-i64`, `char->i64`,
  `i64->string`, after FX-26's own `int->i64`.
- **Not chosen:** redefining `string-length` and the rest at `i64`, which
  FX-26 would allow but which reads as the standard `int` versions.

## C8. Constants as functions (2026-10-11)

- **Chosen:** `(define x T e)`, `e` not a lambda, is `fn x() -> T { e }`,
  and each use `x()`.
- **Not chosen:** a `static`, which Rust allows only for constant
  initialisers; a lazily initialised cell, more runtime than the mapping
  wants.
- **Why:** trivial, and equal to FX-26's meaning while `e` is pure; the
  compiler's one constant is a string.
